# 🌍 World Demographics Analysis using SQL

This project demonstrates SQL skills through a series of exercises using a real-world dataset on global population and demographic indicators.

## 📊 Project Objective

Analyze worldwide demographic data using SQL to answer key questions about:
- Population size and growth
- Population density
- Migration trends
- Fertility rates and median age
- Countries' share of the world population

The project is structured as a complete and clean SQL workflow, from database creation to data insertion and exploration.

## 🗂️ Dataset Description

**Source**: [Worldometers - Population by Country (2020)](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/)

The dataset includes information for countries and dependent territories with valid values (entries marked "N.A." are excluded).

### Key Variables:
- `name`: Country or territory name
- `population`: Total population
- `percent_one_year_change`: Annual growth rate (%)
- `population_change`: Absolute annual change
- `density_per_sq_km`: Population per square kilometer
- `area_sq_km`: Total area in km²
- `net_migrants`: Net migration figures
- `fertility_rate`: Average number of children per woman
- `median_age`: Median age of the population
- `percent_of_world_pop`: Country’s share of world population (%)

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- SQL database creation and setup (`CREATE DATABASE`, `USE`)
- Table creation with appropriate data types and constraints
- Bulk data insertion
- Data modeling and schema design
- Use of SQL comments for readability and documentation
