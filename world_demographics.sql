/*
** World Demographics Analysis Project **
Data Source: 
http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/

Context: This project aims to answer key demographic questions about global population dynamics using SQL queries.

The dataset includes countries and dependent territories (2020), excluding entries with "N.A." values.
*/

/* STEP 1: Creating and Setting Up the Database */
-- How do we structure a database to analyze global demographic data?
-- Create a database to store and analyze demographic information.
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
SHOW DATABASES; -- Verify database creation
USE mydatabase; -- Set 'mydatabase' as the active database


/* STEP 2: Creating the Table */
-- What attributes should we track for countries' demographic analysis?
-- Create a table to store demographic data for countries and territories.
CREATE TABLE countries(
   name                    VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY, -- Country or territory name
   population              INTEGER,                 -- Total population
   percent_one_year_change REAL,                    -- Percent change in population over the last year
   population_change       INTEGER,                 -- Absolute population change over the last year
   density_per_sq_km       INTEGER,                 -- Population density per square kilometer
   area_sq_km              INTEGER,                 -- Total area in square kilometers
   net_migrants            INTEGER,                 -- Net migration figures
   fertility_rate          REAL,                    -- Average fertility rate
   median_age              REAL,                    -- Median age of the population
   percent_of_world_pop    REAL                     -- Percentage of the world's population
);

/* STEP 3: Inserting Sample Data */
-- What is the initial data we want to analyze?
-- Insert records for selected countries.
